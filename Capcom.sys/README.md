# capcomDriverEOP

Capcom.sys was a driver introduced within "Street Fighter V" within some kind of anti-cheat system. It's a vulnerable driver (by design, practically a backdoor) where it disables SMEP and executes a user-provided buffer via an IOCTL call. This vulnerable driver can be used for a variety of things due to the massive security risk it poses, this repository will include a privilege escalation based proof-of-concept exploit. Utilizing a token stealing shellcode payload.

#### Things to keep in mind:

1. For a 32bit system, the input and output buffers for DeviceIoControl both need to be 4
2. For a 64bit system, the input buffer for DeviceIoControl needs to be 8 and the output buffer needs to be 4
3. The function that provides the IOCTL, 0AA012044h is for 32bit, 0AA013044h for 64bit
4. The device name is `Htsysm72FB`, you can get this from devicetree 

The function that gives both vulnerable IOCTLs

```
mov     r11d, 0AA012044h
mov     eax, ecx
mov     esi, ecx
cmp     edx, r11d
mov     r10d, 0AA013044h
jz      short loc_105EC
```

The function that disables SMEP with `mov cr4, rax`

```
sub_107A0 proc near
mov     rax, [rcx]
mov     cr4, rax
sti
retn
sub_107A0 endp
```
