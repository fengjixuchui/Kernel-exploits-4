## AscRegistryFilter.sy

Local BSOD proof-of-concept for AscRegistryFilter.sys (CVE-2020-10234) which is a driver included within Advanced SystemCare 13.2 which is a anti-virus software from IObit. BSOD using a NULL user buffer with a 0 size. Using IOCTL 0x8001E000 tested on Windows 7 x86.

## Capcom.sys

Exploits for Capcom.sys, a driver from a third-party anti-cheat software, includes a logic bug where an IOCTL disables SMEP and takes a user passed pointer. Exploits for various Windows versions.

## EMP_MPAU.sys

Local BSOD DOS exploit POCs for various IOCTLs that pass data to a function that doesn't properly handle user input found within the EMP_MPAU.sys (CVE-2020-9453) driver associated with Epson's Iprojection software, multiple POCs disclosed after the vendor was contacted

## EMP_NSA.sys

Local BSOD DOS exploit POCs for various IOCTLs that pass data to a function that doesn't properly handle user input found within the virtual audio device driver EMP_NSA.sys (CVE-2020-9014) driver associated with Epson's Iprojection software, multiple POCs disclosed after the vendor was contacted

## Ene.sys

Includes both a local DOS POC to replicate the original author's blog post, and also includes a local privilege escalation exploit that takes advantage of a stack buffer overflow in the driver. Ene.sys comes from the ASUS Aura Sync version 1.07.71 software.

## HEVD.sys

Multiple Windows kernel EOP exploits for HEVD.sys, an intentionally vulnerable driver. Exploits cover a variety of Windows kernel vulnerability classes, exploits with and without various mitigation bypasses on a few different versions of Windows.

## MaxProc64.sys

Local BSOD DOS exploit POCs for MaxProc64.sys (CVE-2020-12122), a driver from a third-party "spyware detector" application

## tmcomm.sys

Local BSOD DOS exploit POC for tmcomm.sys from TrendMicro RootkitBuster, multiple IOCTL calls can result in various types of writes, previously disclosed, but not patched when this POC was written
